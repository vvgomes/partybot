A micro-service to interact with nightclubs. Currently working for some relevant nightclubs from [Porto Alegre](http://bit.ly/1pxkFsR):
- [Beco](http://beco203.com.br)
- [Cucko](http://cucko.com.br)
- [Lab](http://www.labpoa.com.br)

In order to add more nightclubs you just need to define a new driver class under the `lib/drivers` directory. Each running instance of the service must specify a single driver class in a `DRIVER` environment variable.

Enjoy!
